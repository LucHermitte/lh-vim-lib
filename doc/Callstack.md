# Callstack decoding

The topic is about obtaining the current function call stack. Its main
applications relate to plugin maintenance: debugging,
[unit testing](https://github.com/LucHermitte/vim-UT), [DbC](DbC.md),
[logging](Log.md) ...

While Vim knows internally its current call stack, this information isn't
directly available to us ([at this time](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1125)).

Still we can trick vim into giving us the information. The idea is to throw an
exception and to decode
[`v:throwpoint`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#v%3athrowpoint). Note
however that this must not be abused as it could cripple down your plugin
performances.

## API
### `lh#exception#callstack(throwpoint)`
Parses `throwpoint`, in the current locale, to extract the function call stack.

Returns a list of:
- `"script"`: filename of the vim script where the function is defined
- `"pos"`:    absolute line number in this script file
- `"fname"`:  function name
- `"fstart"`: line where the function is defined in the script
- `"offset"`: offset, from the start of the function, of the line where the
            exception was thrown

In case the script file could not be obtained, `"script"` will value `"???"`,
`"fstart"` will value 0, and `"pos"` will value `"offset"`.

Example:

```vim
try
    throw "dummy"
catch /.*/
    let callstack = lh#exception#callstack(v:throwpoint)
endtry
do_something_with(callstack)
```

Note: In a _*nix_ world, or precisely when `bash` is detected, the call stack
is correctly analysed whatever the current locale is. On a pure windows system,
you'd need to stay in a C locale to make sure `v:throwpoint` could be correctly
decoded.

### `lh#exception#decode([throwpoint=v:throwpoint])`
Given a _throwpoint_, creates an [object](OO.md) containing call stack
information.

The object is made of:
- `"callstack"`: [list](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#List)
  returned by [`lh#exception#callstack()`](#lhexceptioncallstackthrowpoint).
- `"as_qf()"`: method that converts the call stack object into a list accepted
  by [`setqflist()`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#setqflist%28%29).

### `lh#exception#get_callstack()`
Helper function to obtain the call stack at the current call-site. It takes care
of throwing the dummy exception. You can see this function as the first main
entry point.

It returns the object returned by [`lh#exception#decode()`](#lhexceptiondecodethrowpointvthrowpoint).

Notes:
- As of vim 8.0-314, the size of the call stack is always of 1 when called from
  a "script. See [Vim issue#1480](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1480).
- It clears the current function level (i.e. the context of
  `lh#exception#get_callstack()` function).

### `lh#exception#callstack_as_qf(filter, [msg])`
Returns the call stack as a list compatible with
[`setqflist()`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#setqflist%28%29). You
can see this function as the second main entry point.

Internally it returns
[`lh#exception#get_callstack().as_qf()`](#lhexceptionget_callstack) filtered
(by [`filter()`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#filter%28%29))
with `filter` parameter.

The typical use case for this function is from plugins that wish to display the
call stack. This way, we can ignore the context injected by these plugins to
display only pertinent information.


### `lh#exception#say_what()`
This function has been inspired by
https://github.com/tweekmonster/exception.vim
It analyses last error message reported by Vim, the call stack is expanded into
as many entries as required, and the result is displayed in the
[quickfix window](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/quickfix.txt.html#quickfix%2dwindow).

A neat way to use it consists in defining the following command (in your
`.vimrc` for instance) -- at this time I don't provide the command
automatically in a plugin script:

```vim
" .vimrc
command! WTF call lh#exception#say_what()
```

The differences (with `tweekmonster/exception.vim`) are the following:
- It supports localized messages
- It supports autoloaded functions, even when `#` isn't in
  [`'isk'`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27isk%27) (that may
  happen depending on the filetype of the current buffer)
- It uses a framework that have been here for little time for other topics
  (logging, unit testing)
- It has as few loops as possible -- 1. I hate debugging them, 2. This permits
  to run faster.

In the end of DbC framework demo, you'll see a live application of
`lh#exception#say_what()`. You'll also see applications of the other call stack
related functions to display the call stack on failed assertions.
